## 🔥 Projects  
Although my contributions were made before some of these projects were uploaded to GitHub, they are acknowledged in the README files of the repositories.

- **[AI Accessibility Tool for Visually Impaired Users](https://github.com/NafisSaleh/AI-Accessibility-Extension-For-Visually-Impaired-Users)** – AI-powered accessibility tool for visually impaired users, using a Transformer-based image captioning model and IBM Watson TTS.  
- **[Real-time Multimodal Emotion Recognition]([#](https://github.com/NafisSaleh/Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition-System))** – Fusion of facial and vocal emotion analysis for human-computer interaction, using OpenCV, PyTorch, and Librosa.  
- **[TableLLM]([#](https://github.com/NafisSaleh/TableLLM))** – A project that explores the capabilities of small LLMs(Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B) to answer questions from tabular data through prompt engineering and fine-tuning with Unsloth.
- **[DNA Sequence Classification With Data Encoding]([#](https://github.com/NafisSaleh/DNA-Sequence-Classification-with-Data-Encoding))** – This project looks into the effectiveness of different encoding techniques for DNA sequence classification using Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.  
- **[Estimating Taxonomic Properties of Fungal Samples Based on Location Information]([#](https://github.com/NafisSaleh/Fungi-Classification-Characteristics-From-Location))** – This is a short research, conducted using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib, on Fungal classification based on features from occurrence location.    
- **[Payment Destination Locator]([#](https://github.com/NafisSaleh/Payment-Destination-Locator))** – GUI-based utility bill payment location finder using Selenium and GeoPy.
- **[Seat Arrangement App]([#](https://github.com/NafisSaleh/SeatSorterFXMaven2))** – A basic JavaFX application that provides seat arrangement in an ordered or random manner depending on the input.
